# WebScraper

Small application to demonstrate the use of web scraping technology.

Users of the app will be presented with some article scraped from a news website.
Then users can save notes on the articles.

This is a single user app so all users will see all notes on the articles. To save or update a note, click anywhere on the article body and a form will appear to the left.
